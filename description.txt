NEW UPDATE - v 0.5.1
-Added an item
-Added several more features that shall not be named to Masochist Mode
-Added Toggle for Super speed and made Super speed more manageable
-Changed how Top Hat Squirrels spawn
-Increased World Shaper Soul's tile placing speed boost
-Made Builder Mode toggle off by default (kind of a meme fix for now)
-removed extra Blue Moon in Slinger's Essence recipe
-fixed Platinum Enchantment's extra loot multiplier being off by one, and it doesn't work on bosses anymore

This mod adds 2 main things. Masochist Mode and Soul accessories.

-Masochist mode is a high IQ difficulty mode that offers a new challenge while not relying on just boosting stats. 
New spawns, tons of new debuffs, new attacks from enemies, and bosses have gone completely insane
This mode is optional.
-Soul accessories are a massive crafting tree of hundreds of items leading into one accessory.
