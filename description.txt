NEW UPDATE - v 0.5.8
-Made Soul of Eternity's stacking not infinite, but a very high limit of 200,000
-Crimson Enchantment now works with Candy Apples and Candy Canes
-Galactic Reformer now insta kills all non boss npcs
-Nerfed all swarm weapons and Cobalt Enchantment slighlty
-Fixed some Masomode and tooltip bugs

This mod adds 2 main things. Souls and Masochist Mode.

-Souls are a massive crafting tree of hundreds of items leading into one accessory. 
-Masochist mode is a high IQ difficulty mode that offers a new challenge while not relying on just boosting stats. 
New spawns, tons of new debuffs, new attacks from enemies, and bosses have gone completely insane
This mode is optional.
