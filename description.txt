This mod adds 2 main things. Souls and Masochist Mode.

-Souls are a massive crafting tree of hundreds of items leading into one accessory. 
-Masochist mode is a high IQ difficulty mode that offers a new challenge while not relying on just boosting stats. 
New spawns, tons of new debuffs, new attacks from enemies, and bosses have gone completely insane
This mode is optional.
