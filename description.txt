MOD RELEASE - v 0.1 
This mod adds 2 main things. Masochist Mode and Soul accessories.
Masochist mode is a high IQ difficulty mode that offers a new challenge while not relying on just boosting stats. 
New spawns, tons of new debuffs, new attacks from enemies, and bosses have gone completely insane
This mode is optional..

Soul accessories are a massive crafting tree of thousands of items leading into one accessory. 
Every armor set has an accessory version, blah blah
