This mod adds 2 main things. Masochist Mode and Soul accessories.

-Masochist mode is a high IQ difficulty mode that offers a new challenge while not relying on just boosting stats. 
New spawns, tons of new debuffs, new attacks from enemies, and bosses have gone completely insane
This mode is optional.
-Soul accessories are a massive crafting tree of hundreds of items leading into one accessory.
